Owning a decent flat in metropolitan cities of India through Halal means is no longer a distant dream. After so many years of patient waiting, contemplation and ground work, we are finally able to arrive at launching housing projects under the banner of **Halal Housing** - a novel housing scheme for the truly faithful. It is a hard reality that many of our brothers and sisters are still not in a position to have a own house in spite of a decent earning for the simple reason that they donâ€™t want to go against the tenets of Islam by taking a conventional home loan from a Bank and fall into the traps of paying interest for the rest of their lives. **Halal Housing** is the result of their patient waiting and putting their complete trust in Allah. \r\n\r\nAlhamdulillah, under this scheme we have already completed one project in Bannerghatta Road, Bangalore and we are just starting our next project in the same vicinity but in a much bigger area. Our mission is to create more and more such projects, that will make housing affordable, simple and enjoyable. \r\n\r\n## Project Summary\r\n\r\nasdfasd fasdfasdf asdf\r\n\r\n## Location\r\n\r\nasdfasdf asdfasdf asdf\r\n\r\n## Floor Plans and Elevation\r\n\r\nasdfasdf asdfasdf\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\nasdfasdfasdfasdf\r\n\r\n## Pricing & Payment\r\n\r\nadsfasdfasdfasdf",
