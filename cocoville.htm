<p><b>Bismillahir Rahmaanir Raheem</b> - <em>In the Name of Allah the Most Beneficent, The Most Merciful!!</em></p>    

<p>We are extremely glad to inform you that we are all set to officially launch our fourth project named "CocoVille" in Balaji Gardens, Gottigere, Bannerghatta Road, Bangalore. </p>

<p>Here is the gist of this novel scheme - Pay a minimum of 35% initially of the total cost and balance in upto 48 <B>Interest Free EMI (as low as Rs.41 Sq.Ft) </B> . For example, if the total cost of a flat is 30 lakhs, then you pay 10.50 lakhs (35%) minimum payment (1 lakh as booking amount and rest 9.50 lakhs at the time of sale agreement) and the balance 19.50 lakhs in maximum 48 <strong>Interest FREE</strong> EMI’s. We are sure this sounds very attractive and irresistible.</p>

<p><em>Alhamdulillah</em>, under this scheme we have already completed three projects, one at Old Madras Road and two other projects in Bannerghatta Road, Bangalore. Please refer <strong>history of Halal Hosuing projects</strong> below. Our mission is to create more and more such projects, that will make housing affordable, simple and enjoyable and sin free. Allah has helped us to start our fourth project <strong>Cocoville @ Bannerghatta Road, Bangalore</strong>.</p>

<button class="accordion">Highlights</button>
<div class="panel">      
<p>
<li>Basic cost only Rs. 2,690 Sq.Ft</li>
<li>Interest Free EMI as low as Rs.41 Sq.Ft&nbsp;</li>
<li>Four years to pay entire amount in affordable <u>interest free EMIs</u></li>
<li>Earn rental income from third year(Inshallah).</li>
<li>Proposed Gottigere metro station is just 1 KM away.</li>

<button class="accordion">Why Gottigere</button>
<div class="panel">
<p> Once upon a time Gottigere was one of the many village on Bannerghatta rd but now it has beomce the one of the most saught after location in south bangalore.
    This is the reason why you see some of luxary apartments( Valmark Apas/ Valmarl CityVille/Mantri Pinnecle) and many premium apartment projects
    Purvanka panorama, Prestige Noting hills, Mantri Residency, Ajmera, Valmark Amoda, Valmark Ananda, Nandi Retreat, Nandi Garden , Nandi Citadel, Nandi Deepa.
    There are plety of mid/small size builders too.
</p>

<p>
    Two most stretegic advantage this area has is the NICE rd and propsoed Metro station.  
</p>


<p>
    Due to recent and rapid urbnization this area has seen very rapid development. Though for some people its may sound like another corner of city but this area has its own small eco system now, people living in this area can get everything they need within proximity. 
</p>

<p>
  Since its closure to electronics city and many other IT companies in south Bangalore, and closure to plenty of prestigous school and college. You would find 
  a lot of people who live here are electronics city commuter or those whose kids goes to these school/colleges. </p>
