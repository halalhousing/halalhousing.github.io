<a id="about-us" class="anchor" href="#about-us" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Us</h2>

<p>If there is a will there are multiple ways. Owning a decent flat in metropolitan cities of India through Halal means is no longer a distant dream. After so many years of patient waiting, contemplation and ground work, we are finally able to arrive at launching housing projects under the banner of <strong>Halal Housing</strong> - a novel housing scheme for the truly faithful. It is a hard reality that many of our brothers and sisters are still not in a position to have a own house in spite of a decent earning for the simple reason that they don’t want to go against the tenets of Islam by taking a conventional home loan from a Bank and fall into the traps of paying interest for the rest of their lives. <strong>Halal Housing</strong> is the result of their patient waiting and putting their complete trust in Allah. </p>

<p><em>Alhamdulillah</em>, under this scheme we have already completed one project in Bannerghatta Road, Bangalore and we are just starting our next project in the same vicinity but in a much bigger area. Our mission is to create more and more such projects, that will make housing affordable, simple and enjoyable. </p>

<p>Here is the gist of this novel scheme - Pay a minimum of 36% upfront of the total cost and balance in maximum 36 EMI’s (Interest FREE) which is <em>Three Years</em>. For example, if the total cost of a flat is 30 lakhs, then you pay 10.80 lakhs (36%) minimum upfront payment and the balance 19.20 lakhs in maximum 36 <strong>Interest FREE</strong> EMI’s of approximately <strong>Rs.53,333/-</strong> each. We are sure this sounds very attractive and irresistible, <em>Alhamdulillah</em>.</p>
